% Part of the problem at this stage is the lack of uniqueness. There are
% many repetitions in both the names of the locations and there are
% multiple places within the geograhic dataset that have the same name 

% So now there are nearly 35,000 matches between the geographic name
% dataset and the notebooks.

%% Step next.  elevation relationship between mapped dike and geographic named place
%  There is an elevation for each notebook dike.  There is an elevation for
%  each of the geographic named features.

% Set a threshold elevation relationship so that they are close enough to
% to each other that if they're outside a 300 or 500 m elevation range I
% should throw out that match as not helpful.
